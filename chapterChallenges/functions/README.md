Looping a Triangle:

##Learning Competencies:
* Understanding basic Javascript methods
* Be able to create a *for loop*
* Display output using **console.log**

##Summary
If we wanted to display objects one-by-one from an array it would prove very redundant to do so if we were forced to use **console.log** for each line, which is why *for loops* are so important. Being able to display ten numbers on the screen with two lines of code sounds much more efficient, to **console.log**ing tens times in a row. 

##Challenge
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following traingle:
'''

#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
'''
It maybe useful to know that you can find the length of a strin by writing *.length* after it. 

'''

var abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
==> 3
'''
