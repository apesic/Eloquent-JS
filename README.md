Eloquent-JS
===========
## Learning Competencies
* Learning JAVASCRIPT


##Summary
These challenges have been taken from the Eloquent JavaScript PDF file. This book dives into JS immediately, providing elaborate explanations for every topic in the chapters, but more importantly challenges which engage the reader/programmer. 

The challenges are inside the jsChallenges director where subsequent directories for each chapter follow in numeric order.  Each chapter, except for chapter 1,  have multiple js challenges. There are 20 directories with README.md for each providing an idea and hints for the challenges. 

If you haven't read Eloquent Javascript, I would suggest that you don't read the text verbatim, rather skim through and jump into the challenge as soon as you have a basic understanding. <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript, second edition, Margijn Haverbeke</a>
