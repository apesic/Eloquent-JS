// HINTS...

// The string can be built by starting with an empty one ("") and repeatedly adding characters. A newline character is written "\n".

// Use console.log to inspect the output of your program.

// To work with two dimensions, you will need a loop inside of a loop. Put curly braces around the bodies of both loops to make it easy to see where they start and end. Try to properly indent these bodies. The order of the loops must follow the order in which we build up the string (line by line, left to right, top to bottom). So the outer loop handles the lines and the inner loop handles the characters on a line.

// Youâ€™ll need two variables to track your progress. To know whether to put a space or a hash sign at a given position, you could test whether the sum of the two counters is even (% 2).

// Terminating a line by adding a newline character happens after the line has been built up, so do this after the inner loop but inside of the outer loop.
